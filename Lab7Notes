AppRater Activity gets the Apps
-------------------------------
The activity gets the apps it will display from the AppContentProvider class as a Cursor
of Apps
-This is similar to how the JokeList Activity in Lab 4 got a Cursor of Jokes from the JokeContentProvider
-The AppRater Activity's ListView then uses the AppCursorAdapter class to bind AppViews to the cursor of Apps

AppDownloadService
-------------------
The AppRater Activity starts this service in order to add new Apps to the underlying database
-The new Apps are retrieved from a website through this Service
-Using a Service is like launching a new Activity except that there is no User Interface
for the Service
-The AppDownloadService then downloads and inserts new Apps into the database if they do not
already exist, and occasionally checks for new Apps to add as long as it is running
-In order to insert new Apps into the database the AppDownloadService must use the 
AppContentProvider's insert() method via accessing a Content Resolver
	-This is similar to the download functionality covered in Lab 5
-Once the AppDownloadService has successfully added a new App, it broadcasts a special Intent
with a certain action associated with it
-The AppRater Activity will use its internal DownloadCompleteReceiver class to listen for and
match that special Intent
-When it sees the Intent ti knows that it has to update the list of apps in AppRater with a 
new Cursor
-Once an App is downloaded into the list, it may then be installed by clicking on it to launch
the Play Store that shows the information about the App as it appears in the store
-The user can then test the app freely outside of the AppRater app
-The Apps that are installed are marked as such in the ListView via a non-interactive CheckBox
as well as the background color mentioned above
-A user can give each App a rating
	-the user can apply a rating to an app via a RatingBar
-The AppRater Activity then saves the changes to the App through the AppContentProvider using a custom
OnAppChangeListener 

cursor.setNotificationUri(getContext().getContentResolver(), uri);
-------------------------------------------------------------------
when this is called, the CursorLoader gets the cursor back and registers an observer

getContext().getContentResolver().notifyChange(uri, null);
-----------------------------------------------------------
-so when someone modifies data this method is called, and ContentProvider notifies 
ContentResolver about the changes
	-in turn, ContentResolver in turn notifies all registered observers
	-so the observer, which is registered by CursorLoader, forces the CursorLoader (cursor)
	to load new data
	
AppView
-------
This is the View representation of an App in the list of Apps, and contains data from an internally
stored App object
-Three main components
	-A TextView containing the name of the app
	-A non-interactive CheckBox (the user cannot change its checked state)
	-A RatingBar that lets the user dynamically change their rating of the app
	
RatingBar
---------
-acts as a subclass of a progress bar
	-the user can touch a star to give the RatingBar a rating or slide their finger along
	the RatingBar until they release it, and then the rating is set
-Can change the size of the default RatingBar in two ways
	-modify the step size
		-example enable half-star ratings (set the step size as 0.5)
	-the number of stars and set the current rating at any time
-have the option of styling the RatingBar to add custom rating "star" images, sizes and 
progressive drawing
	-means Android has a built-in mechanism to automatically fill in an image in the bar based on step size,
	so you only need to provide a full and empty "star" image
-it has its own Listener for detecting a rating change

Restrictions of RatingBar
------------------------
-if change size of RatingBar to small, you lose the ability to interact with the RatingBar entirely
-if want an interactive RatingBar, Google discourages placing any components to its left or right
-if you want to change the number of stars in the RatingBar, you must declare its layout_width
to be wrap_content
	-anything else will produce unpredictable rendering results
-you can choose to style your own RatingBar to change its size and other properties while still
preserving interactivity
	-but then must worry about supporting multiple screen densities and sizes
		-which means stuck having to create a series of icons for each density or be
		forced to limit the size of the stylized RatingBar to the size of the custom icons
		-even then, may see a stretched 'bleed' effect on custom rating bar styles
		
Focus problem for the ListView's OnItemClickListener
-----------------------------------------------------
-don't need to set each focusable component inside the root ViewGroup to non-focusable
-just set the root ViewGroup's descendantFocusability property
	-it defines the relationship between the ViewGroup and its descendants when looking for a view to take focus
	Must be one of the following constant values.
		Constant	Value	Description
		beforeDescendants	0	 The ViewGroup will get focus before any of its descendants.
		afterDescendants	1	 The ViewGroup will get focus only if none of its descendants want it.
		blocksDescendants	2	 The ViewGroup will block its descendants from receiving focus.
		
PackageManager Class
--------------------
class for retrieving various kinds of information related to the application packages that are currently installed on the device

Services
---------
-a Service is like an Activity without a user interface that runs in the background
-an application can start a Service, let it do its thing in the background, and still provide app functionality without any disruption to its user
-any time you need to perform long and/or routine tasks in code, consider enlisting Services to help accomplish this
-Key points to services
	-Services are not separate processes
		-when launched, they run in the same process as the application they were started in
		-this means you should not use them for work-heavy processes like playing MP3s
	-Services are not threads
		-they are not a method for working off of the main running thread
		-however, IntentServices, do have their own thread
	-Services can be accessed by other applications than the one that started them
		-this creates a sort of client-server interface, but requires much more code setup than running a service local
		to just one application
	-Services are not AsyncTasks
		-AsyncTasks are designed to run very short operations that do one thing and quickly exit
		-Services are designed to run for longer events and even when application Activity isn't open
		-we want to run recurring code on a timer over more than just a few seconds, so we will not be using AsynTask
		
IntentService
-------------
-is a Service started using an intent
-it is a base class for Service(s) that handle asynchronous requests (expressed as Intent(s)) on demand
	-clients sent requests through startService(Intent) calls
	-the service is started as needed
	-handles each intent in turn using a working thread, and stops itself when it runs out of work
-this "work queue processor" pattern is commonly used to offload tasks from an application's main thread
	-the IntentService class exists to simplify this pattern and take care of mechanics
	-it will receive the Intents, launch a worker thread, and stop the service as appropriate
	-all requests are handled on a single worker thread - they may take as long as necessary (and will not block the application's main loop) but
	only one request will be processed at a time
	
Anonymous Inner Class
----------------------
-an anonymous inner class can come useful when making an instance of an object with certain "extras" such as overloading methods, without
having to actually subclass a class

button.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e)
    {
        // do something.
    }
});

Using this method makes coding a little bit quicker, as I don't need to make an extra class that implements ActionListener -- 
I can just instantiate an anonymous inner class without actually making a separate class.

App Market Information URI
--------------------------
-this is the URI corresponding to the app's information/installation page if you search for and touch the app in the Google Play Store

intent.addCategory(Intent.CATEGORY_DEFAULT)
-------------------------------------------
-Categories provide additional detail about the action the intent performs. When 
resolving an intent, only activities that provide all of the requested categories will be used.
-Set (Intent.CATEGORY_DEFAULT) if the activity should be an option for the default 
action (center press) to perform on a piece of data. Setting this will hide from 
the user any activities without it set when performing an action on some data. Note that this is normal 
-not- set in the Intent when initiating an action -- it is for use in intent filters specified 
in packages

Including IntentService: have to change Manifest file
----------------------------------------------------
-need to include tags for service
-since downloading data from a file hosted online, need to include a permission for accessing 
the internet
